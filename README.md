# Identity Lab

IdentityLab seeks to provide an automated, standardized way in which to explore Identity and Access Management (IAM) topics, procedures, and products.

## Acknowledgements

IdentityLab stands on the shoulders of Chris Long's excellent DetectionLab project. Read more about Detection Lab on the [project web site](https://detectionlab.network/) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/clong/DetectionLab) or on [Medium](https://medium.com/@clong/introducing-detection-lab-61db34bed6ae)

## Purpose

This lab seeks to allow the user to explore Identity and Access Management (IAM) concepts, ideas, practices, and products, using the most common infrastructure and endpoints. By building on top of the DetectionLab project, IdentityLab provides a Windows domain with security tools and best practices for system logging, enabling easier review of the impact of IAM products and procedures.

NOTE: The DetectionLab warning bears repeating. This lab has not been hardened and runs with default vagrant credentials. Please do not connect or bridge it to any networks you care about. This lab is deliberately designed to be insecure; the primary purpose of it is to provide visibility and introspection into each host.

## Building Identity Lab

*Note*: If you only want to run hosts, you only need a valid, working Vagrant environment.

Being based on Detection Lab, Identity Lab has the same requirements.
