# Contributing to Identity Lab

I am certainly not going to get everything right! Feel free to make contributions to Identity Lab, especially:

* Bug fixes / reports
* Configuration enhancements
* Feature additions / enhancements
* Tooling additions / improvements

Note that some of the features in Identity Lab are based on Chris Long's Detection Lab. While I strive to pull updates from and contribute enhancements to the upstream Detection Lab project, consider supporting that project directly also.

The following types of changes should be maintained on a personal fork and should **not** be submitted as a PR:

* Switching out software purely for personal taste (e.g. replacing Splunk with ELK)
* Changes that are not portable

Adding additional boxes / VMs should be considered carefully.

* Is your addition something that would benefit the entire community?
* Does it use proprietary or licensed software that others can not run legally?
* Does it represent a risk to your employer by exposing potentially sensitive configurations, data, or topography?

## Pull requests

All contributions are submitted via pull requests open against the [master](https://github.com/ealaney/IdentityLab/tree/master) branch.

If you're unfamiliar with GitHub or how pull requests work, GitHub has a very easy to follow guide that teaches you how to fork the project and submit your first PR. You can follow it [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

Once you submit your PR, it will be held for approval.

If the reviewer requests changes, please submit those changes by **appending new commits** to your feature branch.

Once your pull request is approved, the PR is ready to merge. A maintainer will merge your PR into master at this point in time.

By contributing to IdentityLab you agree that your contributions will be licensed as defined on the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.
